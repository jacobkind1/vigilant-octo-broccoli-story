Once upon a time there was a young lad who lived by the sea. He lived there with
his mother and spent his days fishing. He did this to feed himself and his mother.
This dude's name was Bob and he loved his mom very much! He would often spend hours on the lake fishing for his favorite person.

One day he caught a huge fish. The fish looked as big as two people, covered 
with silver scales. The young man thought that the fish would definitely sell 
a lot of money. 

"Psst...Wanna buy some gold?", asked the fish. 
"Gold? But aren't you silver?" replied the boy. 
"Well yes, but I don't want to harm myself. Instead I steal from the golden fish. Maybe you should eat him instead."
The boy though for a moment. Maybe this fish could help him get rich quick. 

The boy made a deal with the fish, every week he would feed the silver fish and in return, the fish would bring him gold scales with equal weight as the food. This kept going for months as the boy accumulated his wealth until one day the silver fish disappeared. 

Although Bob never saw the silver fish again, he never forgot how much the fish had  blessed his mother and himself with great wealth. As years passed he 
looked back and thought that maybe the fish was the spirit of his father, who perished at sea long ago in search for treasure. 

The End!
