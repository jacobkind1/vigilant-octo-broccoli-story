Once upon a time there was a young lad who lived by the sea. He lived there with
his mother and spent his days fishing. He did this to feed himself and his mother.
This dude's name was Bob and he loved his mom very much! He would often spend hours on the lake fishing for his favorite person.

One day he caught a huge fish. The fish looked as big as two people, covered with silver scales. 
The young man thought that the fish would definitely sell a lot of money. 

"Psst...Wanna buy some gold?", asked the fish. 
"Gold? But aren't you silver?" replied the boy. 
"Well yes, but I don't want to harm myself. Instead I steal from the golden fish. Maybe you should eat him instead."
The boy though for a moment. Maybe this fish could help him get rich quick.
